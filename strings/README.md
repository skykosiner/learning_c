# How do strings in c work?
- In c strings are usually a array of different charters using pointers
- ```char * name = "Yoni";``` means that you can change the item in the
  variable later
- ```char name[4] = "Yoni";``` mean that you can't change the value later
  and that the item in the string/array has to be 4 charters long
